# Accuracy score

This script calculates accuracy scores  (accuracy, precision, f-measure, recall) for a list of [UPOS tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/) where the number of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) is given (see **measurement_data.txt**).
Furthermore, the script returns which tag has the best accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure. 
## How to use the script

```python
$ python3 accuracy_scores.py measurement_data.txt
```
